Game-Working
============

This contains files for our game. 

I worked with Nigel Swan, Kyle Higel  and Aaron on some part of this.


I am focusing on the stick game to ensure that it is fun and it also ties in greatly to the premise of the game.

Feel free to fork the repository and use the code, in parts, for your own work. It will be nice to give credit to us if you use it. 

Please, try not to use the IDEA to create the same game in a different way or even copy the whole code as yours.
