Game-Working
============

This contains files for our game. 

I worked with Nigel Swan, Kyle Higel  and Aaron Stewart on some part of this.


Your objective is to balance up the resources in both worlds, dethrone the King and vanish him in a final battle.

Your accomplish this through three mini games. 

In the first mini game, you collect a life source. In the second, you transfer the life source through a portal and in the third mini game, you break a barricade through series of successive clicks and the finally, you dethrone the king and vanish him.


I am focusing on the stick game (the game that lets you transfer the life sources through the portal) to ensure that it is fun and it also ties in greatly to the premise of the game.

Feel free to fork the repository and use the code, in parts, for your own work. It will be nice to give credit to us if you use it. 

Please, try not to use the IDEA to create the same game in a different way or even copy the whole code as yours.

The Good News is that this game won an award for the game with the best
dramatic elements. This was by nomination and voting by other game
designers in our game design class. Others who came to playtest the
games on display also voted.

I know that more work has to be done on this game to make the graphics
and look more awesome while also keeping it minimalistic but for now,
here is what we have.

Use part of the code as you please. But please, do not use the complete
game idea as yours. Ask me any questions you have and please, I welcome
your feedback. If you want to partner to help make this better, we can
discuss that. In fact, you are more than welcome to email me.
