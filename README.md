Game-Working
============

This contains files for our game. 

I worked with Nigel Swan, Kyle Higel  and Aaron Stewart on some part of this.


Your objective is to balance up the resources in both worlds, dethrone the King and vanish him in a final battle.

Your accomplish this through three mini games. 

In the first mini game, you collect a life source. In the second, you transfer the life source through a portal and in the third mini game, you break a barricade through series of successive clicks and the finally, you dethrone the king and vanish him.


I am focusing on the stick game (the game that lets you transfer the life sources through the portal) to ensure that it is fun and it also ties in greatly to the premise of the game.

Feel free to fork the repository and use the code, in parts, for your own work. It will be nice to give credit to us if you use it. 

Please, try not to use the IDEA to create the same game in a different way or even copy the whole code as yours.
